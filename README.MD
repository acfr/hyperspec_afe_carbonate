# Carbonate Feature Extraction from Hyperspectral Image Cube

This Python script extracts and visualises carbonate features from a hyperspectral image cube using Automated Feature Extraction (AFE), as described by Murphy et al. (2017).

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the script on the example data located in the data/ directory:

```bash
python ImagePlotAFE.py
```

The example data located in the data/ directory was acquired from a coral sample provided by H. V. McGregor.  See McGregor and Gagan (2003) for more information.

## Output

The script will generate visualisations of extracted carbonate features, which will be saved as an image file and displayed interactively.
